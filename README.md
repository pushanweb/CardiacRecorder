# CardiacRecorder

A simple, attractive, intuitive, Android mobile app to monitor blood pressure and heart rate data.

Specifically, each measurement has the following fields: 
* date measured (presented in dd-mm-yyyy format) 
* time measured (presented in hh:mm format) 
* systolic pressure in mm Hg (non-negative integer) 
* diastolic pressure in mm Hg (non-negative integer) 
* heart rate in beats per minute (non-negative integer) 
* comment (textual, up to 20 characters)  

The app allows the user to: 
* show a list of measurements 
* add a new measurement (which always appends to the bottom end of the list) 
* view and edit the details of an existing measurement 
* delete a measurement 
* see unusual blood pressures highlighted or flagged. 

**N.B.:** Normal pressures are systolic between 90 and 140 and diastolic between 60 and 90.
